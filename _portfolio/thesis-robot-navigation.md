In 2020, I worked on thesis titled "Robot Navigation From Natural Language Instructions" during my final year. The main idea was to interact with Robot by instructing in natural language instead of some prefixed commands. So the thesis was completely in Natural Language Understanding and combining with a software to navigate.
The thesis paper is attached here:
