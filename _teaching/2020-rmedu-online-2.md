During the COVID-19, I along one of my department juniors arranged few online sessions for the freshers during COVID19.
AS they were in first year, we wanted to keep them motivated and engaged in something productive.
They also enjoyed learning through those interactive sessions.

How the sessions went:
=======
* Introduced about programming and problem solving.
* Took sessions on basic C programming and implementing solutions.
* Arranged two months long virtual contest for practicing.
